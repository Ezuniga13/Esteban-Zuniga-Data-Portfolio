# [Project 1 Yankee Home Run Estimator: Project Overview](https://github.com/Ezuniga13/Home-Run-regression)

- Built and trainded a Linear Regression Model to predict Yankee player home runs.
- I scraped over 1000's of stats from the website [Sports-Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com) using Python, Selenium and Beautiful Soup. 
- Engineered features from coefficients using statsmodel and Python.
- Optimized Linear, Ridge, Lasso regression using Stochastic Gradient Descent.

# [Project 2 Loan Default Predictor ](https://github.com/Ezuniga13/loan-classification)

- Built and trained a logistic regression model to predict whether an applicant would default on a loan.
- Used historical data from the Lending Club dataset.
- Engineered features from a linear regression using Sci-kit Learn
- Selected features from fields such as debt-to-income ratio, income, credit score, home ownership, years of employment.
- Modeled the default risk by comparing 3 supervised classification models. (Logistic, Random Forest, Decision Tree)
- I was able to predict a default applicant depending on risk tolerance of the lender.
